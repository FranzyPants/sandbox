Hey Jacob! I have a request for you.

I would like to know how to gather input from the user. Right now, the two programs we've done only spit out information. I want to let the user pick the output this time. For example, can we write a program that prompts the user for their favorite car, then does something like "It looks like 'input' is your favorite car".
