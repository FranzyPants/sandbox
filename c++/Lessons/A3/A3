>>Remember:

% operator ONLY works with integers!!

Greater than- >
Less than- <
Greater or equal to- >=
Less or equal to- <=
Equal to- ==
Not equal to- !=
And- &&
Or- ||

When using a char put in '' (ex: yn='Y')

You can convert a datatype by "typecasting", multiplying the target datatype into the equation
Syntax: variable=(variable'sDatatype)variableOfOtherDatatype;
Ex:
----------
int sum;
double x=1.1, y=2.1;

sum=x+y; //Because the sum 3.2 is not int, this will cause problems

sum=(int)(x+y); //This will properly convert 3.2 to 3 as integer

>>Here is your project:

The program you are writing is for a cash register. It must:
-Ask the user if they would like to use the register
     -Say "Goodbye!" if they do not and exit program
     -Continue to rest of program if they do
     -Work for these inputs: Y y N n
     -Say "Invalid Answer" if they input invalid letter and exit program
-Display a header for the register (see sample outputs)
-Ask for an item price
-Add tax to the price and display total
-Ask how much they gave to pay
     -If they didn't give enough, say "Not enough money!" and exit program
-Display what the change is
-Display how much of each bill/coin for the casher to give



***GOOD LUCK!!!!***
